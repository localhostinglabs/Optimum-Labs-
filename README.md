# Overview
Optimum is an international payments project that aims to integrate blockchain finance into retail tourism spending. With Optimum, customers can eliminate the need for converting to multiple currencies for each travel, cut costs and top up cryptocurrency instantly. Merchants can access their funds immediately without having to rely on settlement clearing times, and this unlocks dormant capital that can be used productively. The logic is simple ; customers spend XRP or a fiat-pegged stablecoin, and the merchant receives the funds in their preferred cryptocurrency supported on XRPL. The merchant is free to off-ramp into local fiat currency using a local exchange or custodian as needed. 

NFTs are digital rewards; this may come in the form of stamps,tickets, landmarks, proof of visit or usable coupons. There is so much potential for creative usage of NFTs in a market that is as character-friendly as Japan. 

Our vision can be summed up as; to modernise the way we spend money on a retail level, and reward users in the form of digital ownership(NFTs). 

# XPRL
We chose XRPL due to its native advantages over other similar blockchains. Fast settlement time, low fees, regulatory clarity, native tokens such as RLUSD and XRP are viewed as strategic advantages for utilising them in cross-border payments.

**1. XRP:** XRP's Deep liquidity allows for pathfinding and autobridging to efficiently settle transactions between tokens. It can also work as the single medium of exchange that can be held or off-ramped easily.

**2. RLUSD:** USD-pegged stablecoin to provide reliable value for merchants to hold as a balance as an alternative to XRP. 

**3. NFTs:**  Digital rewards that engage users with our ecosystem while having capabilities to be used as a promotional and marketing tool.
