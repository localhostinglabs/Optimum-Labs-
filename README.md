# Optimum-Labs-
This is the public github repo for Optimum Labs Pty Ltd. We aim to demonstrate Optimum's integration of XRPL testnet including XRP transactions and NFT mintage for facilitating tourism spending on XRPL.

Optimum is an international payments project that aims to integrate blockchain finance into retail tourism spending. Think of how we currently spend money overseas as a tourist- either a bank card that charges hefty fees or apps like Wise where you have to deal with varing fees and currencies, top-up delays and pending transactions. With Optimum, customers can eliminate the need for converting to multiple currencies for each travel, cut costs and top up cryptocurrency instantly. Merchants can access their funds immediately without having to rely on settlement clearing times, and this unlocks dormant capital that can be used productively. The logic is simple ; customers spend XRP or a fiat-pegged stablecoin, and the merchant receives the funds in their preferred cryptocurrency supported on XRPL. The merchant is free to off-ramp into local fiat currency using a local exchange or custodian as needed. 

NFTs are digital rewards; this may come in the form of stamps,tickets, landmarks, proof of visit or usable coupons. There is so much potential for creative usage of NFTs in a market that is as character-friendly as Japan. 

Our vision can be summed up as; to modernise the way we spend money on a retail level, and reward users in the form of digital ownership(NFTs). 

We chose XRPL due to its native advantages over other similar blockchains. Fast settlement time, low fees, regulatory clarity, Ripple's strategic partnerships, native tokens such as RLUSD and XRP are viewed as strategic advantages in utilising them for cross-border payments.
